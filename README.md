# sex_prediction_vbm

This repository provides several folders including code to create the analysis-input for a sex classification analysis based on vbm-data and to compute
further results of the ML-analysis output.

Each folder contains a separate ReadMe.

For each folder, a script called "Script_00_define_input_paths_call_functions.m" is included.
In this Script, environment-specific paths to the respective data can be defined. All further functions are independent
of the environment and are called by starting the script. Folder with numbers of the respective function that created
the folder will be creating when running the script.

Order of folders:
1) Code_create_analysis_input
2) Code_create_transgender_input_Aachen
3) Code_create_transgender_input_Barcelona
